1) polymorphism
-> An object behaving differently at different instance of time is called Polymorphism.
There are two types of polymorphism 
>Run time polymorphism-Invoke of the method is decided at the run time
>Compile time polymorphism- Invoke of the method is decided at the compile time

*compile time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading
method overloading--two methods having same method name but different parameters.

*run time polymorphism is achieved by method overriding


2)Constructor chaining
-> A constructor calling another constructor within the same class is called constructor chaining

3)Inheritence
->The process of acquiring proprties from one class to another class is called inheritance

4)Encapsulation
->The process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit is called encapsulation
 
*encapsulation can be achieved by the follwing ways
>having private data members
>default constructor
>using getter and setter methods
